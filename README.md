# 🛍️ Smart-Customer-Profiling-and-Targeting-Using-Unsupervised-ML-Visualization 

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques and visualizing the results through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**. It was developed as part of my Data Science internship at **Celebal Technologies**.

## 📌 Project Highlights

* Applied **KMeans**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, and **Gaussian Mixture Models** to segment customers based on age, annual income, and spending score.
* Developed an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to:

  * Select clustering algorithms dynamically.
  * Visualize customer clusters in 2D.
  * Display performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix (for KMeans), and Silhouette Score.
  * Generate insights and personas for each customer segment.
  * Compare clustering algorithms visually.

## 📁 Dataset

* Dataset: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
* Features used: `Gender`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Implementing unsupervised learning algorithms in real-world use cases.
* Creating intuitive dashboards using **Streamlit**.
* Extracting actionable insights from raw data.
* Evaluating clustering performance using metrics like Silhouette Score and confusion matrix.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
